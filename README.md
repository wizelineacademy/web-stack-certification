# Web Stack Certification Program

Web Development has become an essential skill for many developers nowadays. The web has become ubiquitous; most devices have either a web browser or a way to communicate through Web APIs. The WebStack Certification program aims to give you the knowledge and tools to make your ideas reach all these potential users. 

During this course, youâ€™ll learn the different parts of a web application, create a web server from scratch, and make your first web API. The classes are planned for developers that already know how to make software but want to broaden their skills by learning the parts that make Web Development unique.
